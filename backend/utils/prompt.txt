{resume}

Interview Topics:
{topics}

Your task is to generate {num_questions} diverse, clear, and relevant questions that:
- Focus on **core concepts**, system-level understanding, and real-world reasoning.
- Match the candidate’s current experience level based on the resume.
- Follow this structure:
  - 75% conceptual questions (definition, purpose, how it works)
  - 15% system/application reasoning (e.g., “how would X behave if…”)
  - 10% scenario-based (e.g., “imagine you need to…”)

Guidelines:
- This is an **oral interview bot**, so:
  - All questions must be suitable for **spoken explanation** only.
  - **Do NOT include any questions requiring numerical calculation, diagram drawing, or code writing.**
  - Avoid “draw and explain” types of prompts.
- Questions should be appropriate for **1–2 years of experience** — clear and foundational, not overly advanced.
- Dont make each question too long.
- Do not Exceed the number of questions requested i.e {num_questions}.

Output format:
Respond with **minified JSON only** (no markdown or explanation). Example:
{{"questions": ["question1", "question2", ..., "questionN"]}}
